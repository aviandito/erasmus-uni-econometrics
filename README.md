# erasmus-uni-econometrics
R Markdown for the train exercises in Erasmus University Rotterdam's ["Econometrics: Method and Application"](https://www.coursera.org/learn/erasmus-econometrics), delivered through Coursera. Yes, it is written in our favorite language R. Answers are verified against the solutions provided in the course, but please let me know if there's any error.

Only contains the *train* exercises, not the tests, so go away cheaters!
